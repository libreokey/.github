## The Libreokey Project

### What is libreokey?
Libreokey is an open-source alternative to the classic Turkish board game, [Okey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okey). We are currently planning to make offline with bots mode and also a multiplayer mode.
We haven't decided on the programming language we will use to make this project possible, though we will figure it out and manage the project in the following weeks. We are only 2 people who are developing this project, so to support us we do not want any donations, but rather report an issue if you find any bugs, or even give ideas.

**IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE PROJECT: As of writing this, the project will be delayed for a while since we aren't always free. We will take action in the following months, or it may be even sooner.** _(I will delete this section once we start working on the project)_
